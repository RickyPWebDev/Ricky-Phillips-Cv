          <h2>Junior Front end developer </h2>

          <p>Studying for a computing Degree part time with the open university 
             I have covered a module called TM284:Web technologies, this taught 
             me web technolgies such as HTML,CSS,JavaScript and PHP. We covered 
             version control, development methods such as agile, waterfall and scrum. 
             We looked at web accessbility for a variety of user's needs. 
             We were continually assessed through tutor marked assigments and a final 
             end of module assessment.
            </p>
          <p>Please see my experience and portfolio to see what level I am with my web 
             developemt skills, I am keen to learn from experienced seniors developers 
             and on the job experience, to grow my career to where I will be the senior 
             developer who the junior devs look upto.

            <h3>Hotel de milton</h3>
            <p>As part of TM284: Web technologies, as part of the final assessemnt
               we were required to design and wireframe for a newly created hotel in
               the milton keynes area. The specification was to include a navigational 
               link and a number of pages including a landing page, booking page, 
               facilities page and location page. A number of images were to be 
               included with a interactive picture galary. 
               To achieve this breif I used HTML to structure the webpages and CSS to style 
               for positioning I used Both Grid and Flexbox. I used a Javascript framework 
               JQuery to achieve the photo galary.

            <h3>Silverdale pharmacy inventory Web App</h3>
            <p> In a voluntary basis I used my front-end developer knowledge to develop 
                the front-end element of a web-based app to collect data from the user. 
                The specification was to collect product, quantity, and price data. I 
                used HTML to set the structure and CSS to style. To collect user data 
                I used JavaScript, using variables to capture data and then feedback 
                to the user using the Dom.
                This app is designed to be used internally.

            <p> As part of TMA284:Web technologies we were tested through 3 Tutor marked assignments 
                and one end of module assesement. For TMA 01 we were given a wiframe and was asked to 
                impliment this to a functioning proto-type using HTML and CSS. We were also assessed on 
                web accessiblity, I forfilled this requirment through the use of alt atributes for my images 
                and the choice of font size and topology.
